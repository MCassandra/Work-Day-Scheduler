# Work-Day-Scheduler

Week 5 Third Party-APIs. This assignment uses starter code to create a day scheduler.

## How it works:

* A user is able to input a task at on every hour and save their tasks.

* When the user closes and reopens the page, they see the tasks that they saved. 

* The hour blocks should change color based on the time. Red is past time, green is present/future time.
